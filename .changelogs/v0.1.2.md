# üéâ New Release: `@fragment/reactive` Module üöÄ

We're excited to announce a major release focused on the **`@fragment/reactive`** module! This update brings a powerful and efficient way to handle reactive signals and stores, making managing both **reactive values** and **global state** easier than ever. Whether you're building a small app or scaling up to a complex system, this module allows you to encapsulate state and reactivity with minimal boilerplate.

## üåü Key Features & Highlights

### ‚ö° Reactive Signals

- **Fine-Grained Reactivity:** Effortlessly track individual reactive values that notify consumers automatically when updated. Perfect for performance-sensitive applications.
- **Writable Signals:** Update your signals with methods like `.set()`, `.update()`, and `.mutate()`. Flexibly control how your reactive values change over time.
- **Memoized Signals:** Efficiently compute derived values that automatically update based on their dependencies. With an equality comparator, unnecessary updates are prevented.
- **Promises as Signals:** Seamlessly handle asynchronous values with `signalFromPromise()`. React to API calls and promises in your reactive system with ease.

#### Example: Basic Signal

```typescript
import { signal } from '@fragment/reactive';

// Create a reactive signal
const count = signal(0);

// Update the signal
count.set(1);
console.log(count()); // 1

// Derive a new value from the signal
const double = signal(() => count() * 2);
console.log(double()); // 2
```

#### Example: Signal from Promise

```typescript
import { signalFromPromise } from '@fragment/reactive';

// Create a signal from an async function
const data = signalFromPromise(async () => {
  const res = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
  return await res.json();
});

console.log(data.status); // 'pending'

// Later, when the promise resolves
console.log(data.status); // 'resolved'
console.log(data.values); // { ... }
```

### üî• Side Effects

- **Effect Handlers:** Register side effects that trigger whenever a signal they depend on changes. Clean up after them with ease.
- **Untracked Access:** Need to bypass reactivity? Use `.untrack()` to access signal values without registering dependencies.

#### Example: Effect Hook

```typescript
import { effect, signal } from '@fragment/reactive';

const counter = signal(0);

// Register an effect that reacts to signal changes
effect(() => {
  console.log('Counter updated:', counter());
});

counter.set(1); // Triggers the effect and logs 'Counter updated: 1'
```

### üèóÔ∏è Global State with Stores

- **State Encapsulation:** Organize state and logic in cohesive, encapsulated structures with Stores. Manage complex state, track derived values, and ensure atomic updates with ease.
- **Atomic & Immutable:** With stores, your state is immutable and atomic‚Äîno more unintended side effects or messy updates!
- **Derived Values:** Define memoized, derived values that automatically sync with your store's state, ensuring efficient recalculations when dependencies change.

#### Example: Counter Store

```typescript
import { store } from '@fragment/reactive';

// Define a simple counter store
const counterStore = store(({ get }) => ({
  count: signal(0),
  increment: () => get().count.update((c) => c + 1),
  decrement: () => get().count.update((c) => c - 1),
}));

console.log(counterStore.count()); // 0
counterStore.increment();
console.log(counterStore.count()); // 1
```

#### Example: Store with Derived Values

```typescript
import { store } from '@fragment/reactive';

// Create a store with derived values
const counterStore = store(({ get }) => ({
  count: signal(0),
  double: signal(() => get().count() * 2),
  increment: () => get().count.update((c) => c + 1),
}));

console.log(counterStore.double()); // 0
counterStore.increment();
console.log(counterStore.double()); // 2
```

### üõ†Ô∏è Easy Setup

Get started right away with minimal setup! Install via `deno` or `npm` and bring powerful reactivity to your application in minutes.

```bash
deno add @fragment/reactive
```

```bash
npx jsr add @fragment/reactive
```
